# TMS-fMRI_strategic_interaction

Welcome. 

This repository contains Matlab and R code to replicate all figures, fMRI t-maps, and pipelines to estimate the computational models. 

What you will need to run the code for the Figures
up to date version of Matlab with statistical toolbox
R, with ggplot package (http://ggplot2.org) 

For computational modeling, you will need : 
JAGS (http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net)
rJAGS cran package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html) 
R.Matlab to read the .mat files (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/R.matlab/R.matlab.pdf) 

To read the fMRI t-maps.
SPM8 or SPM12 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/) 
SnPM (http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/nichols/software/snpm)
